# AlertGuard
AlertGuard is an IoT-based door alarm system designed to enhance security by wirelessly monitoring the status of doors and sending real-time notifications to an Android app. This system allows users to receive alerts from anywhere, ensuring prompt awareness of door activity. It utilizes a NodeMCU V3 (ESP8266) microcontroller paired with a reed switch door sensor to detect door openings and closings. The alarm can be toggled between "Enabled" and "Disabled" modes via the Android app, providing real-time updates and notifications for enhanced security management.
